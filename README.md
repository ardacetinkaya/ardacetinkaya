👨🏼‍💻 A passionate software developer. I solve complicated problems in a way that computers can understand to provide solutions to people. I do lead and help teams to do their best. I do analyze and think about the suitable design and then implement the necessary solutions. And of course, I do write “code”.<br /><br />
